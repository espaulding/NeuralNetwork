## How to run the program

First, the data files and the executable must be placed into the same folder or directory on your computer. Also, the executable requires that the .NET framework is installed. If you choose to run the executable directly from the command line, you can open a terminal style window and navigate to the directory or folder containing the files. Then, the command Classifier.exe will run the program. The program assumes that the data will be in a file called iris.csv. If the number of neurons per layer is not specified the default is 3 layers with 3 neurons each. However, you can type Classifier.exe 4 12 3 to run the program with a network that has 3 layers with the corresponding number of neurons in each layer.
